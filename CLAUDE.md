# Prova Rails Development with ClaudeOnRails

This project uses ClaudeOnRails to create an intelligent swarm of AI agents specialized in different aspects of Rails development.

## Project Overview

- **Application**: Prova
- **Rails Version**: 8.0.2
- **Ruby Version**: 3.2.2
- **Type**: Full-stack Rails application
- **Test Framework**: Minitest

## How to Use

Simply describe what you want to build or fix, and the swarm will automatically coordinate the implementation:

```bash
# Start the swarm
claude-swarm orchestrate

# Then just describe your task
claude "Add user authentication with email confirmation"
claude "Optimize the dashboard queries that are running slowly"
claude "Create an API endpoint for mobile app integration"
```

## Swarm Architecture

The following specialized agents work together to implement your requests:

- **Architect**: Coordinates all development and makes high-level decisions
- **Models**: Handles ActiveRecord models, migrations, and database design
- **Controllers**: Manages request handling, routing, and controller logic
- **Views**: Creates and maintains views, layouts, and partials
- **Stimulus**: Implements interactive features with Stimulus controllers
- **Services**: Extracts business logic into service objects
- **Jobs**: Handles background processing and async tasks
- **Tests**: Ensures comprehensive test coverage with Minitest
- **DevOps**: Manages deployment and production configurations

## Project Conventions

### Code Style
- Follow Rails conventions and best practices
- Use RuboCop for Ruby style enforcement
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Write self-documenting code

### Testing
- Minitest for all tests
- Fixtures or factories for test data
- Integration tests for user flows
- Unit tests for models and services

### Git Workflow
- Feature branches for new work
- Descriptive commit messages
- PR reviews before merging
- Keep main branch deployable

## Custom Patterns

Add your project-specific patterns and conventions here:

```yaml
# Example: Custom service object pattern
Services:
  Pattern: Command pattern with Result objects
  Location: app/services/
  Naming: VerbNoun (e.g., CreateOrder, SendEmail)
  Testing: Unit tests with mocked dependencies
```

## Notes

- This configuration was generated by ClaudeOnRails
- Customize agent prompts in `.claude-on-rails/prompts/`
- Update this file with project-specific conventions
- The swarm learns from your codebase patterns
